## Monitoring home network with dd-wrt

Last night i was reading about penetration testing and it hit my that how easy it is to stay undetected once attacker gets in the corporate if network traffic is not analyzed enough. So i decided to see what's going on in my network.

I have a router with dd-wrt so it thought that maybe i could use some kernel module to send traffic to some other computer to be analyzed. But after a bit of googling i run into RFlow. RFlow is used to send data from dd-wrt to be analyzed at another computer. So i enabled RFlow and started to look for some applications to analyze data.

Common recommendation was ntop. Sadly ntop wasn't available anymore because they had moved to ntopng. Problem with ntopng was that it didn't include the component used to analyzed the data that dd-wrt sent. Community edition of ntopg is open source but the component used to receive data from dd-wrt is not. So now i'm using demo version of the component, nprobe. 

The data that is sent from dd-wrt is basically NetFlow. NetFlow is cisco protocol that they use in their network infrastructure devices like switches and routers. Normally they are used in much larger networks but it works in my small home network too.
